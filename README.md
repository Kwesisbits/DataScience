## 🔍 Project Highlights

### 1. 🧪 Breast Cancer Classification with Neural Network

In this project, I built and trained a **neural network** model to classify tumors as **malignant** or **benign** using features from a real-world medical dataset. The process involved data normalization, model architecture design, and performance evaluation using accuracy and confusion matrix metrics.

📌 **Key Steps**:
- Data preprocessing and normalization.
- Neural network model built with Keras/TensorFlow.
- Evaluation on test data using accuracy and confusion matrix.

### 2. 💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection

This binary classification problem involved detecting fraudulent transactions using a highly **imbalanced dataset**. I used **logistic regression** and applied **resampling techniques** to address class imbalance, ensuring fair predictions. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, and ROC-AUC.

📌 **Key Steps**:
- Data exploration and handling imbalance with undersampling.
- Logistic regression modeling.
- Performance evaluated using confusion matrix, ROC curve, and classification report.

### 3. 🪙 Gold Price Prediction with Random Forest

In this regression-based project, I developed a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict future gold prices using historical market data. Feature engineering and data visualization were key parts of this workflow. The model performance was assessed using **RMSE** and **R² score**.

📌 **Key Steps**:
- Exploratory data analysis and feature engineering.
- Model training using Random Forest.
- Evaluation with RMSE and R² score.
